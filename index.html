            <h2>Modern Slang I Wish Would Go Away</h2>
            <p><strong>Slang:</strong> six seven</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A slang term often used online or in casual conversations as a joke or
                insult, usually implying something is dumb, pointless, or not worth taking seriously.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Don't Like It:</strong> I don’t like this slang because it feels confusing and unnecessary.
                Many people don’t even know what it means, so it can make conversations harder to understand. Instead of
                clearly explaining an opinion, people use “67” in a dismissive way, which can come across as immature
                rather than funny.</p>

                    ICE and deportations: how immigration enforcement is changing</a></p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why I Liked It:</strong> I liked this article because it explains how current U.S. immigration
                enforcement is changing and why that matters. The authors describe how the Trump administration has
                expanded deportation efforts and the role ICE now plays, which helped me understand the politics and
                human impact behind the news. It also included facts and context rather than just opinions, so I felt
                like I could learn something meaningful from it.</p>
